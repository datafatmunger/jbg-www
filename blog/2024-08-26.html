                <h2>1st day of classes (en_US)</h2>
                <p>I met with my advisor, <a href="https://homes.luddy.indiana.edu/fc7/">Dr. Fan Chen</a>,
                    and brought the following list of items I find interesting:
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07012">CryptoQFL, FHE, QHE</a></li>
                        <li>Clocks, discrete, quantized, time</li>
                        <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05089">Cluster Simulation (MBQC)</a></li>
                        <li>Error Correction (QECC)</li>
                        <li>GPU Quantum Simulation</li>
                        <li>Analog Computer Quantum Simulation (leveraging for example <a href="https://mythic.ai/">Mythic.ai</a>)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>She suggested these were not 1 to 1.5 year topics, but basically 5+ year topics, or PhD topics,
                        and suggested I start research building on work already happening in her group, that said she was open
                    to the idea I start a bigger topic, with the contingency it will be longer to my first publication.</p>
                </p>
                <p>She suggested the following papers to start with:
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10096772">IQGAN: Robust Quantum Generative Adversarial Network for Image Synthesis On NISQ Devices</a></li>
                        <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.00132">QuanTA: Efficient High-Rank Fine-Tuning of LLMs with Quantum-Informed Tensor Adaptation</a></li>
                        <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09529">QDoor: Exploiting Approximate Synthesis for Backdoor Attacks in Quantum Neural Networks</a></li>
                        <li><a href="https://journals.aps.org/prx/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevX.11.041058">Realization of Real-Time Fault-Tolerant Quantum Error Correction</a></li>
                        <li><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9259940">Digital zero noise extrapolation for quantum error mitigation</a></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>I'll be digesting these papers over the next few days.</p>
                </p>
                <p>I had my first meeting of PHYS-P 555: Quantum Computation & Information. I am very excited about this course,
                    but I believe it will be a bit of review from the MIT courses I took earlier this year, in addition to the workshop
                    I did with the University of Applied Sciences Amsterdam (HvA). It's possible I slightly annoyed the professor by bring up
                    entanglement too early and disrupting his lecture.
                </p>
                <p>I left my passport in the TSA security check point in the Detriot airport on the way to Indianapolis, and
                    confronted with the option to either skip our flight to Indianapolis and go back to the security check point, or
                    to continue on to Indianapolis and deal with the issue later. I chose the latter, and I am now in the process of getting
                    a new passport. It's been a nightmare, as I need a birth certificate to get a new passport, and dealing with the Indiana Department of Health,
                    they already issued me a new certificate, with the wrong name of my parents. My mother was able to collect me the correct birth certificate,
                    and hopefully I will be more sucessful in getting the new passport application submitted tomorrow.
